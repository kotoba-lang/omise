  "Stores (お店), opening hours and pickup points — pure data contracts.

  A kotoba-lang capability library for the cloud-itonami-5320 (community
  last-mile courier) open business. No network, no I/O, no clock access —
  the caller always passes the day/time to check, so every function is a
  pure, deterministic contract. Models the records a merchant-facing
  courier operator keeps: store records, weekly opening-hours windows,
  open-at? checks, pickup points, and geo distance between two points.

  Portable (.cljc) across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM."
